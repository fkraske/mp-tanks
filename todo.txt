TODO
trim client-side chronology
send chronology during init
validate timestamps on incoming events on serverside
proper build setup with docker
multiple rooms
MorphableContainer:
  maps composition of: creation event timestamp and creation event info (can be anonymous: doesn't have to be a chronology event), (state computation has to be 100% deterministic for float timestamps to match up)
                   to: entity
separate logic from model since serialization strips methods
state caching
Proper namespace name for morphable
